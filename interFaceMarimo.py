        If not existing, just use 3 times the same. Repeat this for the noise measurements. For any questions, first read the DOCUMENTATION. 
        Secondly have a look in the classes "ExperimentClass.py" and "InvestigationClass.py". Last but not least, you can ask the author of this Code "Leonard Freisem" for further help.""")
